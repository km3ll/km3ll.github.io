## Definitions

#### Semantic Versioning

> Under this scheme, version numbers and the way they change convey meaning about the underlying code and what has been modified from one version to the next. [[>]](https://semver.org/)

## Acronyms

#### ASM

> ASM is an all purpose Java bytecode manipulation and analysis framework. It can be used to modify existing classes or to dynamically generate classes, directly in binary form. ASM provides some common bytecode transformations and analysis algorithms from which custom complex transformations and code analysis tools can be built. [[>]](https://asm.ow2.io/)

#### STOMP

> STOMP is the Simple (or Streaming) Text Orientated Messaging Protocol. STOMP provides an interoperable wire format so that STOMP clients can communicate with any STOMP message broker to provide easy and widespread messaging interoperability among many languages, platforms and brokers. [[>]](https://stomp.github.io/)

#### TOML

> TOML [Tom's Obvious Minimal Language] aims to be a minimal configuration file format that's easy to read due to obvious semantics. TOML is designed to map unambiguously to a hash table. TOML should be easy to parse into data structures in a wide variety of languages. [[>]](https://toml.io/en/)
