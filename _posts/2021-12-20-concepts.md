### STOMP

> STOMP is the Simple (or Streaming) Text Orientated Messaging Protocol. STOMP provides an interoperable wire format so that STOMP clients can communicate with any STOMP message broker to provide easy and widespread messaging interoperability among many languages, platforms and brokers.

### Consistency model

> A consistency model is a set of histories. We use consistency models to define which histories are “good”, or “legal” in a system. When we say a history “violates serializability” or “is not serializable”, we mean that the history is not in the set of serializable histories. [[>]](https://jepsen.io/consistency)
